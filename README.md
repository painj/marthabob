Martha BOB is the story of a maintenance bot who, by unlucky chance, must takeover the Master Modulator role on a starship.
The problem is, the Master Modulator contains 90% of the AI Network, with the Station Robots providing only 10% of the data. 
For example, the Navigation robot needs Martha Bob's help in order to fly the ship!

Currently, you can download a preview of the 'Mini-Game' that is Navigation of the ship. Physics aren't included yet, this is
